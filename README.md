# 🧠 Oklahom.AI - Tulsa's AI Learning Lab 🤖

*Oklahom.AI** is a community resource repository 📚 containing learning materials, code samples, and projects for building with artificial intelligence. 

This initiative is sponsored by the [Tulsa AWS User Group Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/tulsa-aws) at [Gradient](https://www.joingradient.com/) and the [Atlas School](https://www.atlasschool.com/), with the goal of making AI development more accessible to beginners in the Tulsa tech community. 🌟

We will be joining forces with the new [Oklahom.AI](https://oklahom.ai/) group in Oklahoma City for virtual sessions.


## Atlas School & AWS User Group 🤝

Our volunteer-ledseries begins with two foundational sessions at the Atlas School:
- **Session 1**: 🔍 General introduction to product engineering for AI applications
    1. Hands-on deployment of a tiny LLM (Qwen2.5) on an EC2 instance in AWS, using Ollama
    2. Basic terminology and concepts in training, deploying, and evaluating AI models in production
- **Session 2**: 💻 Hands-on deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on AWS
    1. Part 1:  Leveraging AWS Bedrock for simplified AI orchestration
    2. Part 2:  Slow introduction to EdgeAI and deploying a tiny LLM on a Raspberry PI with environmental sensors

You can find materials for these two sessions in the repo directory above.



## AI Learning Lab Sessions 🗓️

Following these initial sessions, we will host bi-weekly (in-person and virtual) meetings featuring new topics, practical exercises, and collaborative projects. All materials, code samples, and documentation will be maintained in this repository for ongoing reference and learning. 🛠️

The goal is to keep you accountable to your learning goals, and provide a supportive community to help you build and iterate quickly on your ideas. 🚀

**We welcome beginners and experienced developers of all levels, and try our best to make the learning experience as accessible as possible.**
