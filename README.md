# 🧠 Oklahom.AI - Tulsa's AI Learning Lab 🤖

**Oklahom.AI** is a community resource repository 📚 containing learning materials, code samples, and projects for building with artificial intelligence. This initiative is sponsored by the [Tulsa AWS User Group Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/tulsa-aws) at [Gradient](https://www.joingradient.com/) and the [Atlas School](https://www.atlasschool.com/), with the goal of making AI development more accessible to beginners in the Tulsa tech community. 🌟

We will be joining forces with the new [Oklahom.AI](https://oklahom.ai/) group in Oklahoma City for virtual sessions.

## Atlas School & AWS User Group 🤝

Our volunteer-led series begins with two introductory session at Atlas School:
- **Session 1**: 🚀 Product engineering for AI applications
    1. Hands-on deployment of a tiny LLM (Qwen2.5) on an EC2 instance in AWS (Free Tier), using Ollama
    2. Basic terminology and concepts in training, deploying, and evaluating AI models in production
- **Session 2**: 🌩️ Language Models on the Cloud and Edge
    1. Part 1:  Hands-on - Leveraging AWS Bedrock for simplified AI orchestration
    2. Part 2:  Hands-on - Intro to EdgeAI and deploying a tiny LLM on a Raspberry Pi with environmental sensors

You can find materials for these two sessions in the repo directory under [Intro Sessions](/Intro%20Sessions).

**We welcome beginners and experienced developers of all levels, and try our best to make the learning experience as accessible as possible.** 


## AI Learning Lab Sessions 🧬

Following these initial sessions, we will host bi-weekly (in-person and virtual) meetings featuring new topics, practical exercises, and collaborative projects. All materials, code samples, and documentation will be maintained in this repository for ongoing reference and learning. 🛠️

    🚀 The goal is to keep you accountable to your learning goals, and provide a supportive community to help you build and iterate quickly on your ideas. 

If you follow the study group's week-by-week self-study schedule with guided review sessions, you will be prepared to take the [AWS AI Practitioner Certification Exam](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/aws-certified-ai-practitioner-aif-c01/) in 2025. You may also choose to opt out and focus on building projects.
