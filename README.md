# Oklahom.AI - Tulsa's AI Learning Lab

Oklahom.AI is a community resource repository containing learning materials, code samples, and projects for developing full stack applications with generative AI models. This initiative is sponsored by the AWS User Group Meetup at Gradient and the Atlas School, with the goal of making AI development more accessible to beginners in the Tulsa tech community.

## AWS User Group & Atlas School

Our orientation begins with two introductory sessions at the Atlas School:
- **Session 1**: General introduction to Product Engineering for AI applications
    1. Hands-on deployment of a tiny LLM (Qwen2.5) on an EC2 instance in AWS, using Ollama
    2. Basic terminology and concepts in training, deploying, and evaluating AI models
- **Session 2**: Understanding AI Orchestration and LLMOps using AWS Bedrock
    3. Quick introduction to AWS Bedrock and the Bedrock Studio interface for quickly creating a deploying AI agents
    4. Slow introduction to EdgeAI and deploying a tiny LLM on a Raspberry PI with environmental sensors

You can find materials for these two sessions in the repo directory above.

Following these initial sessions, we will host bi-weekly meetings featuring practical exercises, theoretical machine learning concepts, and collaborative projects. All materials, code samples, and documentation will be maintained in this repository for ongoing reference and learning.
